 * This test is an example of two important Jest testing principles,

 *  The module, isomorphic fetch, is conveniently mocked automatically be including the file __mocks__/isomorphic-fetch.js adjacent to to the Node.js folder
 * 2) we're using an async function to automatically deal with the fact that our app isn't synchronous
