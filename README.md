Isomorphic React App is a Server-Side Rendering application with All Best Practices.  

### Tech

Isomorphic React App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Redux] - Predictable state container for JavaScript apps
* [redux-saga] - An alternative side effect model for Redux apps
* [Webpack] - Bundle assets scripts
* [Babel] - The compiler for writing next generation JavaScript

And of course Isomorphic React App itself is open source with a [public repository][dill] on GitHub.

### Installation

This app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8+ to run.

Install the dependencies.

```sh
$ move into directory
$ npm install
```

### Start the server

Start the local server on with livereload by webpack: `port:3000`

```sh
$ npm start-dev
```

### Test

Runs the test

```sh
$ npm test
```

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.

```sh
$ jest --watch or npm test --watch
```

### For production

Runs in prod

```sh
$ npm start-test
```

Builds JavaScript for production to the dist folder. 
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

```sh
$ npm build
```
