# Isomorphic React App

![N|Solid](https://agileengine.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/redux-saga.png)

Isomorphic React App is a Server-Side Rendering application with All Best Practices. 

### Tech

Isomorphic React App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Webpack] - Bundle assets scripts
* [Babel] - The compiler for writing next generation JavaScript

And of course Isomorphic React App itself is open source with a [public repository][dill] on GitHub.

### Installation

This app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8+ to run.

Install the dependencies.

```sh
$ move into directory
$ npm install
```

### Start the server

Start the local server on with livereload by webpack: `port:3000`

```sh
$ npm start-dev
```
